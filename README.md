# Advanced Requirements Engineering Project

## Overview

This repository documents the **Advanced Requirements Engineering Project** completed as part of a master's course at **Chalmers University of Technology**. The project involved designing a peer-to-peer storage platform, connecting renters and owners, and emphasizing affordability, user convenience, and a structured requirements engineering process.

This project was conducted in an **Agile framework**, with the team holding **bi-weekly meetings**, enabling **rapid iterations** and maintaining **strong documentation and collaboration practices**. The final deliverables earned a **top grade (5/5)**, reflecting the quality of teamwork and outputs.

## Key Highlights

### **Agile Development Process**

- **Weekly sprints**: Facilitated quick feedback loops and iterative improvements.
- **Bi-weekly team meetings**: Ensured alignment, identified challenges, and refined project deliverables.
- **Collaborative Review**: Peer reviews from other groups provided valuable external feedback.

### **Structured Deliverables**

1. **Experience Report**: Reflections on elicitation techniques, prioritization methods, and teamwork.
2. **Team Agreement**: Established clear roles, expectations, and collaboration principles.
3. Requirements Document: Iteratively developed across three releases, including:
   - Functional and non-functional requirements.
   - Use case diagrams, mock-ups, and prioritization matrices.
   - Change history and rationale for requirement updates.

## Project Process

### **Objectives**

- Apply theoretical knowledge to a realistic requirements engineering project.
- Engage in team-based learning and adapt to real-world challenges.
- Develop and validate requirements through structured methods and feedback loops.

### **Development Phases**

- **Definition**: Established the project mission and scope.
- **Three Iterations**: Incrementally refined requirements and designs in R1, R2, and R3.
- **Review**: Reviewed another groupâ€™s specification and incorporated peer feedback into our own.
- **Conference Presentation**: Summarized experiences, methods, and results in an IEEE-formatted presentation.

## Agile Team Collaboration

- **Teamwork Framework**: Defined expectations and roles in the Team Agreement.
- Tools and Techniques:
  - Requirement elicitation through interviews and brainstorming sessions.
  - Use of mock-ups, context diagrams, and prioritization matrices to refine requirements.
  - Iterative review and reflection to identify and address gaps.
- **Intercultural Collaboration**: Leveraged diverse perspectives to enhance deliverables.
